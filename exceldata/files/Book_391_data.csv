It is thus meant to help the undergraduates (who always want to know that extra bit beyond their textbooks), the postgraduates (who want help with the endocrine cases for examination purposes), the general surgeon (who needs a simplified diagnostic and management protocol for the occasional endocrine case that he comes across), for the MCh endocrine trainee (who needs to have an overview for the final examination) and for the specialist endocrine surgeon (who may need to refresh his knowledge). This book has been written by a single, highly experienced endocrine surgeon working in a sophisticated Indian Endocrine Institution of International renown. The book which is superbly illustrated has the somewhat unusual format of ‘questions and answers’ with an enormous number of illustrative clinical cases all personally managed by the author.

Many women undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle will never achieve a live birth. Failure at the embryo transfer stage may be due to poor embryo quality, lack of uterine receptivity, or the transfer technique itself. Numerous methods, including the use of ultrasound guidance for proper catheter placement in the endometrial cavity, have been suggested as a means of improving the technique of embryo transfer.

Furthermore, in couples with unexplained subfertility, IUI combined with ovulation induction, with clomiphene or gonadotropins, is often chosen before resorting to in vitro fertilization (IVF). The appropriateness of starting with these low and intermediate intensity treatments is supported by evidence that CC/IUI increases cycle fecundity two- to three-fold, and FSH/IUI, three- to five-fold over the baseline chance of pregnancy in this patient group. For these, as well as physical and spiritual reasons, IUI combined with ovulation induction is often a natural starting point for couples, especially when female age and duration of subfertility are favorable. The key to the success with IUI is the use of the most appropriate semen preparation techniques. These techniques, used in IUI, were developed to separate the motile morphological normal spermatozoa.

Interestingly oocyte donation seems to represent the most efficacious method of all assisted reproduction techniques. Moreover, success rates do not appear to vary greatly with the recipient’s age or diagnosis. Medical concerns also remain with regard to egg donation. For instance what genetic and clinical tests should every egg donor undergo? And, should all recipients be allowed to undergo egg donation, or should age, medical and mental limits be set? The wide scope of the present book clearly demonstrates the growing role of egg donation in reproductive care. Dr Gautam N Allahbadia has once again shown his significant merits and abilities by putting together an impressive and wide ensemble of some of the world’s greatest experts in the field of egg donation. The huge body of information assembled for the first time on this subject of growing importance, creates a unique and unprecedented volume.

Social relations are of two types are, associative and dissociative. The scientific study of human population is called demography. The Malthusian is one of the earliest theories on population. India is suffering from population explosion as feared by Malthus. Family is the most important primary social institution. Hindu social organization is characterized by caste system. The four-fold Varna system is the basis of caste system of India. Community Development Programs came into existence on 2nd October, 1951 as an attempt to bring about a social and economic transformation of village life through the efforts of villagers themselves.

Until recently, termination of pregnancy or selective termination of an affected fetus was the option offered to the parents, when a congenital anomaly was diagnosed. Because of our better understanding of fetal physiology and pathology, and the technological improvements implemented during the last decade, many experts in fetal medicine tried to correct the process of a developmental abnormality, early enough in order to prevent a permanent damage to the fetus. Due to the rarity of many conditions in which it is used, the application of fetal therapy is limited at present; however, promising results have been reported in many different trials. Nowadays not only the diagnosis of the presence of more than one fetus in utero is possible, but also early detection and management of complex fetal pathological conditions found in twin or even higher-order pregnancies is feasible. The purpose of this textbook is to provide the obstetricians who are involved in the field of fetomaternal medicine all the uptodate knowledge of indications, complications and results of standard and experimental interventional procedures under ultrasound guidance.

It basically suits women who are producing low levels of hormones for ovulation, or who are not ovulating at all. The association of ovulation induction with cancer has raised concerns. It was hypothesized that epithelial ovarian cancer was linked to recurrent breach of ovarian epithelium at ovulation. Ovulation induction continues to help a large number of infertile women to achieve their goal of pregnancy. The protocols have been refined over the years to give maximum benefit in each cycle initiated. The book “World Clinics Obstetrics and Gynecology: Ovulation Induction” comprises of total 13 articles. First article provides an introduction on ovarian physiology and clinical manipulation. A stepwise approach to induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is described in second article. Mechanism of action, various dose regimes in different clinical settings, side effects, and complications associated with oral ovulogens are discussed in third article. Fourth article describes controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for intrauterine insemination (IUI). Choice of gonadotropin and premature luteinization (PL) are covered in fifth and sixth article. Seventh article explores the various adjuvant therapies to the standard ovulation induction agents to optimize follicular growth as well as minimize the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy. Eighth articles explains ovarian stimulation regimens for in vitro fertilization. Ninth article provides a glimpse on monitoring of ovulation induction. Ovulation trigger regimes are discussed in tenth article. Luteal support and complications of ovulation induction are covered in eleventh and twelfth article.

In women with anemia, loss of smaller volumes can result in hemodynamic instability. Hence, any amount of blood loss that threatens a woman’s hemodynamic status is defined as PPH. To make women strong enough to withstand PPH by correcting anemia during the antenatal period will go a long way in preventing mortality. Women with a previous history of PPH, multifetal pregnancy, uterine myomas, and uterine scars should be offered institutional delivery. However, many cases of PPH may have no identifiable risk factors. Primary PPH occurs within 24 hours of delivery and is associated with a higher mortality rate than secondary PPH. The majority of cases of primary PPH are due to uterine atony (70%). Other causes include genital tract trauma (20%), retained tissue (10%), and coagulopathy (1%). A Cochrane review compared active versus expectant management of third stage of labor and concluded that active management of third stage of labor (AMTSL) lowers maternal blood loss and reduces the risk of PPH by 60%. In low resource settings, where all birthing women may not have an IV access, misoprostol tablets can be administered vaginally or rectally by a skilled birth attendant as part of active management of third stage of labor. If hemorrhage continues, oxytocin infusion is commenced and ergotamine and/or prostaglandins are administered in addition. All healthcare professionals and birth attendants should be trained to prevent and treat PPH. Periodic audit of maternal mortality and near miss cases should be conducted in all delivery suites to identify loopholes and improvise management protocols. A chart outlining AMTSL as well as protocols for management of PPH should be available, along with an emergency obstetric kit, a PPH drug box, and a PPH examination kit (see Appendix E). Patients with secondary PPH should be evaluated for retained products and sepsis. Evacuation of the uterus under ultrasound guidance and use of antibiotics will arrest bleeding. Uterine artery embolization should be considered in resistant cases. Patients who survive PPH may suffer serious psychological and medical sequelae. Immediate medical complications are anemia, sepsis, difficulty in lactation, delayed wound healing, and exacerbation of latent infections like tuberculosis. Serious long-term sequelae are Sheehan and Asherman syndrome.",Hardcover,1,world-clinics-obstetrics-gynecology-postpartum-hemorrhage,20-11-21 20:39

The habit of textbook reading is so deeply ingrained in us that students are loath to search journals for information that is not readily available to them.

Evidence-based approach is the key to the success of any specialty in medicine, so pain management cannot be an exception. Pain physicians often face a dilemma of how to reach correct diagnosis of a particular symptom, such as backache, headache, neck pain, neuropathic pain, ischemic pain, and cancer pain. There is unacceptable variation in clinical management of pain due to inadequate training; distorted physician beliefs; inadequate application of pharmacological, behavioral, interventional, and alternative methods of pain management; and on top of it, lack of access to evidence-based approach. It can be either at the level of pain physician or the surroundings in which he/she is working.

The book has chapters which give introduction to low back pain, vertebral column, articular neurology, and manipulative therapy. Articular neurology is one of the fundamental sciences of manipulative therapy. Manipulative therapy imposes static or dynamic forces across joints in various parts of the body. Pain in the neck and back are common. An examination of the posterior primary rami of segmental nerves reveals many areas where nerve injury may occur. Sitting posture, loss of extension range, and frequency of flexion are the predisposing factors of low back pain. Pain history is important to rule out any treatment protocol. Test movements like flexion in standing, flexion in lying, extension in standing, extension in lying, and side gliding in standing are best options.

It reflects commitment to the principles that, improved understanding of brain-behavior relationships can lead to a higher quality of life for older individuals. Psychiatric manifestations of neurological disorders and the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders are the two pillars standing apart to hold erect the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuropsychiatry is devoted to understanding the neurobiological basis of human behavior. Measurement of cognitive functions and its steady decline is probably the most important evidence of effects of aging on neurology. Young physicians are more inclined to treat acute geriatric problems than the chronic neurological conditions. Many of their conditions are therapeutically controllable if they are detected early. This book deals with study of the effects of aging itself and the age-related diseases on the nervous system. Addresses disorders related to sleep, mood, dementing, neoplastic, nerve, muscle, gait, neurological, and describes managing complex issues for both primary and secondary prevention of geriatric illness.

For these reasons, it seems that the tendency is not to decrease, but quite the opposite. This implies an enormous effort at the clinical level, due to the difficulties involved in the diagnosis and the treatment of the reproductive disorders of each member of the couple; and at the technological level, in the search for progress that provides solutions for the majority of infertile couples. The purpose of this book “Infertility Management Series Basic Laboratory Procedure in ART” is to provide a reliable and updated version of the techniques performed in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) unit and to give an idea of the state-of-the art technologies. Another important point to consider is the design, set-up, and staff that forms the IVF unit, as ultimately it will impact also in the consecution of the clinical objectives. From the most basic techniques, as the conventional in vitro fertilization or the embryo transfer, to the most complex as the genetic diagnosis, the magnetic cell sorting of sperm cells or the use of stem cells to develop into gametes, all have the same importance for the couple whose problem needs solution.

This is not a “quick read” but individual chapters can be used as an excellent starting point for studying an area of interest for the electrophysiologist is they novice or more experienced. Extensive illustrations, case-based discussions, and brief summaries provided at the end of most chapters will provide a perspective on the topic covered in the chapter and guide the readers in applying this information in their daily work. “Practical Cardiac Electrophysiology” is largely clinically oriented and constitutes 47 chapters covering the spectrum of clinical diagnosis and management of arrhythmias, in and out of the electrophysiology laboratory.",Hardcover,1,practical-cardiac-electrophysiology,20-11-21 20:39

Thus this book helps to bridge that communication divide. It explains breast tissue histopathology in simple language and uses the very helpful feature of annotated figures to explain standard pathology terminology. Further it addresses standardized formats for reporting and provides reasons for performing or not performing a particular test or procedure. This information is immensely helpful to all clinicians, including budding breast surgeons and medical and radiation oncologists. Many researchers will also find this text to be a comprehensive resource as they try to place their basic science findings into a clinically relevant context.
