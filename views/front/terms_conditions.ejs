                                <p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable user information to these advertisers or third-party websites. These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or “serve”) the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>
                                <p>Our websites may display targeted advertising based on personal information about users. Although we do not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong></h2>
                                <p>Sriina.COM Payments gives you access to information about your account and your interactions with us for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Information about you may be accessed by logging into your Sriina.COM Payments Account and viewing the “My Account” tab, the list of which will change as our Services evolve.</p>
                                <h2><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></h2>
                                <p><strong>1-</strong> As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of certain services.</p>
                                <p><strong>2-</strong>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the “Which Information Can I Access?” section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>
                                <p><strong>3-</strong>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail or messages from us, please adjust your communication preferences in Your Account on Sriina.COM.com. You may not opt-out of receiving customer service messages related to your account or transactions or other legal notices from us.</p>
                                <p><strong>4-</strong>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, you then may lose the ability to utilize some of our service features, and we recommend that you leave cookies turned on.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Are Children Allowed to Use Sriina.COM Payments?</strong></h2>
                                <p>Our Services are not intended for use by children. Only persons 18 and older are permitted to establish accounts. If you are under 18, you may use our Services only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
                                <h2><strong>User Agreement, Notices and Revisions</strong></h2>
                                <p>If you choose to visit our websites or use our Services, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Notice and the applicable end user agreement, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at Sriina.COM Payments, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>
                                <p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. We may e-mail you with periodic reminders of our notices and conditions. You should check our site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information collected in the past without the consent of affected users.</p>
